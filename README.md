# CSharpBadges
Final Project

This project takes json data (source data can be found at www.teamtreehouse.com/dawson89.json) and runs in a console application.

You will need Visual Code Studio to run this console application. Download the source files. After extracting the zip file you will need to run the file solution in Visual Studio.

You will then need to make sure that Newtonsoft.json is installed using the nuget packagemanager. Next you will need to copy and paste the folowing 3 files allbadges.json,dawson.json, and dawson89.json into the "Debug" folder found under its parent folder "bin."

Ctrl+Shift+B to build the project then click start to run the program application. The program allows you to select the number of bades you would like to view, the number of badges you would like to include in a new export file, and how many you would like to like to view/edit.  

The Favorite category is an addition that was made to the json file. Any addtions or changes that are made in this field will be present the next time the application runs.
